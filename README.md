# Beanl.ink

Are you using [Beanconqueror](https://github.com/graphefruit/beanconqueror), have an urge to share your beans with your friends, but everyone hates you for sending thousands of characters in the links?
Use [Beanlink](https://add.beanl.ink) to shorten the URLs for beanconqueror and make your friends happy by still sharing your beans, but not destroying your group chats with the long messages.
